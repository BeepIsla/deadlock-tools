Dumps hero information from the game files. It will automatically try to find your Deadlock installation directory, if it fails to do so you must provide an argument on the command line: `dump.exe <full deadlock path>`.

Output will be dumped to the current working directory `./heroes/<HeroID>.png` and `./heroes.json`.
